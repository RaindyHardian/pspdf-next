## Getting Started

Install the modules:

```bash
npm install
```

Copy the PSPDFKit for Web library assets to the public directory (or we can copy it manually too):

```bash
cp -R ./node_modules/pspdfkit/dist/pspdfkit-lib public/pspdfkit-lib (or you can copy it manually)
```

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
